# Implementation Plan: Docker-based Playwright API Testing Suite

**Branch**: `001-docker-playwright-api-testing` | **Date**: 2025-10-21 | **Spec**: `.specify/features/docker-playwright-api-testing.md`
**Input**: Feature specification with Docker containers, Playwright TypeScript testing, volume logging, docker-compose orchestration

## Summary

Build a comprehensive Docker-based Playwright API testing suite that validates 5 fake API endpoints (`/posts/1/comments`, `/albums/1/photos`, `/users/1/albums`, `/users/1/todos`, `/users/1/posts`) with TypeScript implementation, docker-compose orchestration, and volume-mounted logging for failure analysis.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode enabled  
**Primary Dependencies**: Playwright Test, Docker, Docker Compose, Node.js 18+  
**Storage**: Volume-mounted logs for test results and failure analysis  
**Testing**: Playwright Test framework with API request context  
**Target Platform**: Docker containers (Linux-based) with cross-platform compatibility  
**Project Type**: Single testing project with containerized execution  
**Performance Goals**: Each test case under 4 minutes, full suite under 15 minutes  
**Constraints**: Docker-only execution, volume logging, double-quote string literals  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 API endpoints, 4 test categories (validation, integrity, errors, performance)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **TypeScript-First Development**: All code in TypeScript with strict typing  
✅ **Playwright E2E Testing**: Using Playwright framework for API testing  
✅ **Clear Documentation**: Major steps commented in test files  
✅ **Dockerized Environment**: All execution within Docker containers  
✅ **4-minute Test Limit**: Individual test cases under time constraint  
✅ **Double Quotes**: All string literals use double quotes consistently  
✅ **Volume Logging**: Failure logs persisted in Docker volumes

**Structure Decision**: Single testing project with Docker containerization. The fake API server runs in a separate container from the test runner, orchestrated by docker-compose. Volume mounting ensures log persistence across container lifecycles.

## Phase 0: Research & Discovery

### API Endpoint Analysis
- Document expected response structures for each endpoint
- Identify data validation requirements (email formats, URL formats, boolean types)
- Define error scenarios and expected status codes
- Research optimal fake API implementation (Express.js with static JSON responses)

### Docker Architecture Research  
- Design multi-container setup (test runner + fake API server)
- Plan volume mounting strategy for persistent logging
- Define container networking for test-to-API communication
- Research Playwright Docker image options and optimization

### Performance Requirements Analysis
- Define response time expectations (2 seconds per endpoint)
- Plan concurrent testing strategies
- Design test isolation to prevent interference
- Define logging levels and failure capture requirements

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design (`data-model.md`)
- Define TypeScript interfaces for all API response types
- Document validation rules for each data field
- Design error response structures
- Create test data factories and generators

### API Contract Definitions (`contracts/`)
- Create JSON schema definitions for each endpoint response
- Document expected HTTP status codes
- Define error response formats
- Establish data relationship validation rules

### Docker Architecture Design
- Design docker-compose.yml with services for test runner and fake API
- Plan volume mounting for logs directory
- Define environment variables for configuration
- Design health checks and service dependencies

### Quickstart Guide (`quickstart.md`)
- Document Docker and docker-compose installation requirements
- Provide step-by-step setup instructions
- Document test execution commands
- Include troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Phase 2: Implementation Phases

### Phase 2.1: Infrastructure Setup
- Create Dockerfile for Playwright test runner with TypeScript
- Create Dockerfile for fake API server with Node.js/Express
- Implement docker-compose.yml with volume logging
- Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode

### Phase 2.2: Fake API Server
- Implement Express server with 5 required endpoints
- Create static JSON response data following API contracts
- Add basic error handling and logging
- Implement health check endpoint for container orchestration

### Phase 2.3: Core Test Framework
- Set up Playwright configuration for API testing
- Implement base test utilities and API client wrapper
- Create TypeScript response validation utilities
- Implement logging utilities with Docker volume integration

### Phase 2.4: Endpoint Testing (Priority P1)
- Implement individual test suites for each of the 5 endpoints
- Add status code validation and response structure testing
- Include clear comments documenting test steps
- Ensure each test completes within 4-minute limit

### Phase 2.5: Data Integrity Testing (Priority P2)
- Implement response data validation tests
- Add email format, URL format, and boolean type validation
- Test userId consistency across user-related endpoints
- Implement comprehensive error reporting

### Phase 2.6: Error Handling Testing (Priority P3)
- Implement tests for invalid endpoints and malformed requests
- Add connection failure and timeout handling tests
- Test graceful degradation scenarios
- Ensure proper error logging to Docker volumes

### Phase 2.7: Performance Testing (Priority P4)
- Implement response time validation tests
- Add concurrent request handling tests
- Create load testing scenarios within time constraints
- Implement performance metrics logging

## Complexity Tracking

*No violations identified - all requirements align with constitution principles*

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Docker networking issues**: Mitigated by using docker-compose networking and health checks
- **Volume permission issues**: Addressed through proper Dockerfile user configuration
- **Test flakiness**: Mitigated by explicit waits and retry mechanisms in Playwright
- **Time constraint violations**: Addressed through performance monitoring and optimization

### Operational Risks  
- **Log volume growth**: Mitigated by log rotation and cleanup strategies
- **Container resource limits**: Addressed through resource limit configuration
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Mitigated by using official Docker base images

## Success Metrics Tracking

- ✅ All 5 endpoints return 200 status within 2 seconds
- ✅ 100% data field validation coverage achieved
- ✅ Full test suite execution under 15 minutes
- ✅ Consistent results across multiple container executions
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging captured in Docker volumes
- ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors with strict mode
- ✅ All major test steps clearly commented and documented
