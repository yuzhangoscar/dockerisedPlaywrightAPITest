## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if staffed adequately
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### Critical Path for MVP (Focus on User Story 1)

1. **T001-T005**: Project setup and configuration
2. **T006-T016**: Docker infrastructure with up-to-date Playwright image
3. **T017-T021**: Write failing tests for all 5 endpoints
4. **T022-T028**: Implement fake API server with all endpoints
5. **MVP Ready**: `docker-compose up && npm test` should pass all P1 tests

### Docker Container Readiness

**Prerequisites for running tests against API endpoints:**
1. T006: Up-to-date Playwright Docker image created
2. T007-T008: Fake API server containerized
3. T009: docker-compose orchestration configured
4. T016: Health checks and service dependencies working

**Validation Command**: `docker-compose up -d && docker-compose ps` (all services healthy)

### User Story Independence

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 mock data but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent error handling validation
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent performance validation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All T001-T005 can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T010-T015 can run in parallel after T006-T009 complete
- **User Story Tests**: All test creation tasks (T017-T021, T029-T032, etc.) can run in parallel
- **Mock Data**: All mock data files (T010, T033-T035) can be created in parallel
- **Different User Stories**: Can be worked on by different team members simultaneously

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Core API Validation Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - enables Docker container execution)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Core endpoint validation)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Execute `docker-compose up && npm test` - all endpoints should work
5. Deploy/demo if ready for stakeholder review

### Docker-First Approach

1. **Priority**: Get Docker containers running with up-to-date Playwright image (T006)
2. **Validation**: Ensure `docker-compose up` starts both test runner and fake API successfully
3. **Testing**: Verify tests can execute against containerized API endpoints
4. **Iteration**: Add test cases incrementally while maintaining containerized execution

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation Ready**: Docker containers operational, basic test framework working
2. **MVP (US1)**: All 5 API endpoints validated ‚Üí Immediate value demonstration
3. **Quality (US2)**: Data integrity validation ‚Üí Production-ready quality
4. **Robust (US3)**: Error handling ‚Üí Production resilience
5. **Performance (US4)**: Load testing ‚Üí Scalability validation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Core validation) - Highest priority
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Data integrity) - Quality focus
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Error handling) - Resilience focus
- **Developer D**: User Story 4 (Performance) - Scalability focus

## Docker Execution Validation

### Container Startup Checklist

- [ ] **Playwright Container**: Uses latest official image, TypeScript configured
- [ ] **Fake API Container**: Express server running, health check responding
- [ ] **Service Networking**: Containers can communicate via docker-compose networking
- [ ] **Volume Logging**: Log directory mounted and writable
- [ ] **Test Execution**: `npm test` runs successfully within Playwright container

### Key Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are healthy
docker-compose ps

# Execute tests
docker-compose exec test-runner npm test

# View logs
docker-compose logs fake-api
docker-compose logs test-runner

# Cleanup
docker-compose down -v
```

### Success Criteria

- **T006 Complete**: Latest Playwright Docker image built and tested
- **Container Health**: All services start and pass health checks
- **Test Execution**: Tests run successfully against containerized API endpoints
- **Volume Logging**: Failure logs persist in mounted Docker volumes
- **Time Constraints**: Individual tests under 4 minutes, suite under 15 minutes
