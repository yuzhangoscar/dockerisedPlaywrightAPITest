# Feature Specification: Docker-based Playwright API Testing Suite

**Feature Branch**: `001-docker-playwright-api-testing`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a docker based playWright that tests against a number of fake api endpoints; the tests should send requests to given api enpoints,and verify the their responses. The available nested routes are, /posts/1/comments, /albums/1/photos,/users/1/albums,/users/1/todos /users/1/posts"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Core API Endpoint Validation (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to validate that fake API endpoints return expected data structures and status codes, so that I can ensure my application handles API responses correctly.

**Why this priority**: Forms the foundation of all API testing - without basic endpoint validation, other testing scenarios are meaningless.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending HTTP requests to each endpoint and validating response structure, status codes, and basic data integrity. Delivers immediate value by confirming API contract compliance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send GET request to "/posts/1/comments", **Then** I receive 200 status code with array of comment objects containing id, name, email, body fields
2. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send GET request to "/albums/1/photos", **Then** I receive 200 status code with array of photo objects containing id, title, url, thumbnailUrl fields
3. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send GET request to "/users/1/albums", **Then** I receive 200 status code with array of album objects containing id, userId, title fields
4. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send GET request to "/users/1/todos", **Then** I receive 200 status code with array of todo objects containing id, userId, title, completed fields
5. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send GET request to "/users/1/posts", **Then** I receive 200 status code with array of post objects containing id, userId, title, body fields

### User Story 2 - Response Data Integrity Validation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to verify that API responses contain valid, properly typed data with logical relationships, so that I can trust the data quality for application integration.

**Why this priority**: Ensures data consistency and prevents integration issues that could cause application failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by validating data types, required fields, and logical relationships within response data. Delivers value by ensuring data quality meets application requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** API returns comments data, **When** I validate the response, **Then** all comment objects have valid email format in email field and non-empty body text
2. **Given** API returns photos data, **When** I validate the response, **Then** all photo objects have valid URL format for url and thumbnailUrl fields
3. **Given** API returns user-related data, **When** I validate the response, **Then** all objects contain correct userId matching the requested user (userId: 1)
4. **Given** API returns todos data, **When** I validate the response, **Then** completed field contains only boolean values (true/false)

### User Story 3 - Error Handling and Edge Cases (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to test API error scenarios and edge cases, so that I can ensure my application handles failures gracefully.

**Why this priority**: Important for robust application behavior but not critical for basic functionality validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending invalid requests and validating error responses. Delivers value by ensuring proper error handling patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send GET request to non-existent endpoint "/posts/999/comments", **Then** I receive appropriate error status code (404) with error message
2. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send malformed request, **Then** I receive 400 status code with descriptive error message
3. **Given** the API server is unavailable, **When** I attempt to connect, **Then** test framework handles connection timeout gracefully

---

### User Story 4 - Performance and Load Testing (Priority: P4)

As a developer, I want to validate API response times and concurrent request handling, so that I can ensure performance meets application requirements.

**Why this priority**: Performance testing is valuable but not critical for basic functional validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring response times and sending concurrent requests. Delivers value by validating performance characteristics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send requests to all endpoints, **Then** each request completes within 2 seconds
2. **Given** the API server is running, **When** I send 10 concurrent requests to the same endpoint, **Then** all requests complete successfully without errors

### Edge Cases

- What happens when API server returns malformed JSON responses?
- How does system handle network timeouts and connection failures?
- What happens when API returns unexpected status codes (500, 503)?
- How does system handle rate limiting if implemented on API endpoints?
- What happens when API returns empty arrays or null values?
- How does system handle very large response payloads?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST execute tests within Docker containers for consistent environment isolation
- **FR-002**: System MUST use Playwright framework for HTTP request handling and response validation  
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate HTTP status codes for all API endpoint requests
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate JSON response structure and required fields for all endpoints
- **FR-005**: System MUST verify data types and format constraints (emails, URLs, booleans)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate relational data consistency (userId matching across related endpoints)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle and report connection failures and timeouts gracefully
- **FR-008**: System MUST complete each individual test case within 4 minutes maximum
- **FR-009**: System MUST use TypeScript with strict typing and double quotes for strings
- **FR-010**: System MUST include clear comments documenting major test steps
- **FR-011**: System MUST support parallel test execution where possible
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate detailed test reports with pass/fail status and error details

### API Endpoints Coverage

- **EP-001**: `/posts/1/comments` - Comments related to specific post
- **EP-002**: `/albums/1/photos` - Photos within specific album  
- **EP-003**: `/users/1/albums` - Albums belonging to specific user
- **EP-004**: `/users/1/todos` - Todo items for specific user
- **EP-005**: `/users/1/posts` - Posts created by specific user

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Comment**: Represents user comment on a post (id, name, email, body, postId)
- **Photo**: Represents image within an album (id, title, url, thumbnailUrl, albumId)
- **Album**: Represents photo collection (id, title, userId)
- **Todo**: Represents task item (id, title, completed, userId)
- **Post**: Represents user blog post (id, title, body, userId)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-003**: Test suite completes full execution in under 15 minutes total runtime
- **SC-004**: All tests pass consistently across multiple Docker container executions
- **SC-005**: Test reports provide clear pass/fail status with detailed error messages for failures
- **SC-006**: Code coverage includes positive scenarios, data validation, and basic error handling for all endpoints
- **SC-007**: Docker container startup and test initialization completes within 2 minutes
- **SC-008**: Test suite can be executed independently without external dependencies beyond the fake API server
